#  **Green Energy Market Intelligence Dashboard**

## **Overview**
This project focuses on building a **data-driven business intelligence solution** to evaluate the market performance of **five renewable energy products** and their marketing creatives across U.S. states.  
Using **Tableau, Power BI, and Excel**, the project analyzes over **58,000 prospect records**, revealing key insights into product adoption, creative efficiency, and geographic engagement to guide strategic marketing and product positioning.

---

##  **Objectives**
- Evaluate **product performance** across five renewable turbine categories (DualForce, AeroSpin, GuardianWind, SecureSpin, WeatherWise).  
- Measure **creative engagement** across four marketing campaigns (C1‚ÄìC4).  
- Analyze **geographic distribution** and identify high-performing vs underpenetrated states.  
- Recommend **data-backed marketing realignments** to optimize ROI and market share.

##  **Business Problem**
The company faced challenges in:
- Identifying **underperforming products** due to lack of campaign-level analytics.  
- Uneven creative utilization (e.g., overuse of C1 "Renewable Defender").  
- Limited insights into **regional performance and audience segmentation**.  

As a result, marketing funds were being allocated inefficiently, reducing overall campaign impact.
